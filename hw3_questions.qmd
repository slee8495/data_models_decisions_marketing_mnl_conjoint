This assignment uses uses the MNL model to analyze (1) yogurt purchase data made by consumers at a retail location, and (2) conjoint data about consumer preferences for minivans.


## 1. Estimating Yogurt Preferences

### Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1,0)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, size, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta} + e^{x_4'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=\delta_{i4}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \times \mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$


### Yogurt Dataset

We will use the `yogurt_data` dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (`id`), a vector indicating the chosen product (`y1`:`y4`), a vector indicating if any products were "featured" in the store as a form of advertising (`f1`:`f4`), and the products' prices (`p1`:`p4`). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1's purchase.  Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.

_todo: import the data, maybe show the first few rows, and describe the data a bit._

Let the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we'll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts' prices:  

$$ x_j' = [\mathbbm{1}(\text{Yogurt 1}), \mathbbm{1}(\text{Yogurt 2}), \mathbbm{1}(\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p] $$

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). 

What we would like to do is reorganize the data from a "wide" shape with $n$ rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a "long" shape with $n \times J$ rows and a single column for each covariate.  As part of this re-organization, we'll add binary variables to indicate the first 3 products; the variables for featured and price are included in the dataset and simply need to be "pivoted" or "melted" from wide to long.  

_todo: reshape and prep the data_


### Estimation

_todo: Code up the log-likelihood function._

_todo: Use `optim()` in R or `optimize()` in Python to find the MLEs for the 5 parameters ($\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_f, \beta_p$).  (Hint: you should find 2 positive and 1 negative product intercepts, a small positive coefficient estimate for featured, and a large negative coefficient estimate for price.)_


### Discussion

We learn...

_todo: interpret the 3 product intercepts (which yogurt is most preferred?)._

_todo: use the estimated price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. Use this conversion factor to calculate the dollar benefit between the most-preferred yogurt (the one with the highest intercept) and the least preferred yogurt (the one with the lowest intercept). This is a per-unit monetary measure of brand value._

One benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).

_todo: calculate the market shares in the market at the time the data were collected.  Then, increase the price of yogurt 1 by $0.10 and use your fitted model to predict p(y|x) for each consumer and each product (this should be a matrix of $N \times 4$ estimated choice probabilities.  Take the column averages to get the new, expected market shares that result from the $0.10 price increase to yogurt 1.  Do the yogurt 1 market shares decrease?_
